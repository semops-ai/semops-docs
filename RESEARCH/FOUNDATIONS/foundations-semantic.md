# Foundations: Semantic Systems and Architecture

Foundational theories for defining, representing, and managing meaning in technical systems. These provide the philosophical and logical basis for semantic precision, grounding, and consistency.

---

## Formal Ontology Engineering
*(W3C, OWL, RDF, Description Logics)*

**What it is:**
A discipline for defining the *meaning* of concepts, relationships, and constraints using machine-interpretable structures.

**Key ideas:**
- Classes, properties, individuals
- Subsumption hierarchies
- Ontology alignment
- Description logics (DL) used for inference
- W3C standards for semantic interoperability

**Why it matters:**
Provides the foundation for semantic precision, grounding, and consistency across systems.

## Knowledge Representation & Formal Semantics
*(Guarino, Smith, Sowa, Brachman & Levesque)*

**What it is:**
The foundational study of how knowledge should be structured for reasoning—distinct from data modeling.

**Key contributors:**
- Nicola Guarino — Formal Ontology, OntoClean
- Barry Smith — Basic Formal Ontology
- John Sowa — Conceptual Graphs
- Brachman & Levesque — KR theory

**Why it matters:**
Provides the philosophical & logical basis for identity, classification, and constraints.

## Library & Information Science
*(Cataloging, Classification, Metadata Theory)*

**What it is:**
The science of organizing, describing, and retrieving information long before digital systems existed.

**Key ideas:**
- Metadata standards
- Controlled vocabularies
- Taxonomies
- Authority records
- Information retrieval models

**Why it matters:**
Modern enterprise catalogs, glossaries, ontologies, and metadata systems trace their lineage to LIS principles.

## Organizational Learning & Knowledge Creation

**What it is:**
The study of how knowledge is generated, shared, and applied across people and teams, developed by [Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995)](https://hbr.org/product/the-knowledge-creating-company/10238-HBK-ENG), [Argyris (1992)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/organisational-learning-ii/), and [Senge (1990)](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/301861/the-fifth-discipline-by-peter-m-senge/).

**Key ideas:**
- Tacit vs. explicit knowledge (Nonaka)
- SECI model of knowledge creation
- Double-loop learning (Argyris)
- Learning organizations (Senge)

**Why it matters:**
Explains why meaning cannot be assumed and must be cultivated intentionally.

## Cognitive Systems Engineering

**What it is:**
The study of sensemaking and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments, developed by [Hutchins (1995)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262581462/), [Endsley (1995)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA284688.pdf), and [Woods & Hollnagel (2006)](https://www.routledge.com/Joint-Cognitive-Systems/Woods-Hollnagel/p/book/9781032081280).

**Key ideas:**
- Situation awareness (Endsley)
- Distributed cognition (Hutchins)
- Cognitive work analysis (Rasmussen)
- Joint cognitive systems (Woods & Hollnagel)

**Why it matters:**
Provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how meaning is constructed in teams and systems.

## Socio-Technical Systems Design

**What it is:**
The theory of how social and technical systems co-evolve and how meaning lives at their intersection, developed by [Trist & Emery (1960s)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-98372-000) and [Mumford (1995)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/designing-human-systems).

**Key ideas:**
- Joint optimization
- Role of norms and shared mental models
- Human–technology coordination

**Why it matters:**
[Semantic coherence](../../SEMANTIC_OPERATIONS_FRAMEWORK/SEMANTIC_OPTIMIZATION/semantic-coherence.md) functions as a socio-technical property.

**Sources:**

## Semiotics & Meaning Theory

**What it is:**
The study of signs, meaning, interpretation, and symbol grounding, developed by [Peirce (1930s)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-semiotics/) and [Saussure (1916)](https://archive.org/details/courseingenerall00saus).

**Key ideas:**
- Sign–signifier–signified
- Meaning as relational
- Triadic models of interpretation
- Symbol grounding

**Why it matters:**
Modern semantic technologies—from ontologies to LLM grounding—are grounded in semiotic principles.

**Sources:**
- Peirce Semiotics: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-semiotics/
- Saussure: https://archive.org/details/courseingenerall00saus

## Agent-Based Modeling

**What it is:**
A computational approach for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to understand system behavior.

**Key ideas:**
- Agents as autonomous decision-makers
- Emergent behavior from agent interactions
- Rules governing agent behavior
- Environment as context for agent actions

**Why it matters:**
Provides the theoretical foundation for the OAR (Objects, Agents, Rules) component of the [Semantic Funnel](semantic-funnel.md). Understanding systems as agents acting on objects according to rules enables both human and AI system design.

## Business Rules

**What it is:**
The formal specification of business logic, constraints, and policies that govern operations and decisions.

**Key ideas:**
- Declarative specification of constraints
- Separation of rules from implementation
- Rule engines and inference
- Policy as code

**Why it matters:**
Rules are crystallized understanding—decisions that already happened, now encoded so transformation can occur without requiring fresh decisions. The [Semantic Funnel](semantic-funnel.md) uses rule types (structural, interpretive, normative, meta-rules) to describe how understanding is encoded at each [DIKW](dikw-theory-comparison.md) level.
